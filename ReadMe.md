## SomeInterestingFun
#### A collection of interesting scripts with which I visualized some models.

1. #### 3d graph
   
   Script for visualizing 3d graphs, slices.

2. #### 3x+1
   
   The 3x+1 problem concerns an iterated function and the question of whether it always reaches 1 when starting from any positive integer. It is also known as the Collatz problem or the hailstone problem.

3. #### Turtle
   
   A small script that draws a pattern that resembles a turtle. This code may be interesting in the concept of drawing one line art.

4. #### Slot
   
   Code that simulates the scrolling of a simple slot.
